Top medics on Wednesday warned British political parties that local
flare-ups of the novel coronavirus are likely and a second wave is a
real risk. “While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict,
the available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly
likely and a second wave a real risk,” the medics said in an open letter
to British political leaders. Those who signed the open letter in the British Medical Journal
included Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons,
Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians and
Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency
Medicine. “Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are
beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain,” they
said. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that pubs, restaurants  and hotels could reopen in England early July, easing the coronavirus lockdown that has all but shut the economy. The UK has one of the world’s worst official death tolls from the
novel coronavirus, though the lockdown has tipped the UK towards the
deepest economic contraction in three centuries. The medics called for a review of what needs to be done to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases. “It should focus on those areas of weakness where action is needed
urgently to prevent further loss of life and restore the economy as
fully and as quickly as possible,” the medics said. Others who signed the open letter included Anne Marie Rafferty,
president of Royal College of Nursing, Maggie Rae, president of the
Faculty of Public Health, and Richard Horton, editor in chief of the
Lancet. (Reuters/NAN) Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
