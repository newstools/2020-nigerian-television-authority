The Gombe State Task Force on CODIV-19 says it will commence the
distribution of 1 million free face masks to residents on Wednesday. Prof. Idris Mohammed, the Chairman of the task force, disclosed this  in Gombe on Tuesday while updating newsmen on the management of CODIV-19  in the state. He said distribution of the face masks would commence on May 6 as part of measures to curtail the spread of the disease. He said the exercise would take some days to reach all corners, while calling on the public to be patient. He, however, said that the government would not enforce strict orders
on the use of face mask until it made the masks available to a
significant number of people. According to him, the committee has received reports that people have
not been complying with social distancing and other measures put in
place by government to curtail the spread of the pandemic. He regretted that people were still coming into, and passsing
through, the state on motorcycles by bush paths in spite of the fact
that all entries to the state were closed. Mohammed further said that the task force had received donations of three ambulances and protective equipment.
