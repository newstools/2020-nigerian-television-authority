President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with family, friends and
professional colleagues of former Group Managing Director of Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr Maikanti Baru. The President, in a condolence message by his spokesman, Mr Femi
Adesina, in Abuja on Saturday, also commiserated with government and
people of Bauchi State, management and staff of NNPC over the passing of
the former GMD. Buhari noted that the deceased worked ”very hard to initiate reforms
in virtually all departments of the of the corporation, bringing it up
to speed with global trends and best practices.” He also acknowledged Baru’s contributions to ensuring stability in
the oil sector in Nigeria, with a more guaranteed supply and predictable
price regime that weakened unscrupulous parallel marketers, especially
during festive seasons. The President prayed that the Almighty God would receive the soul of  the departed, grant eternal rest, and comfort all who mourned him.
