The Kebbi State Beach Soccer Foundation has donated 10 cartons of  hand sanitisers and soaps to Medicaid Cancer Foundation, to minimise  spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the state. Malam Yahaya Sarki, Special Adviser to Gov. Abubakar Atiku-Bagudu of
Kebbi State on Media, stated this in a statement in Birnin Kebbi. He said the Medicaid Cancer Foundation was championed by the wife of the Kebbi State Governor, Dr Zainab Bagudu. Sarki said the donation was made during a recent courtesy call on the
governor’s wife, who is also the Grand Matron of Kebbi Beach Soccer
Team. Presenting the items, Malam Abdullahi Yahaya, Secretary of the
Foundation, said the gesture was part of their support for the Medicaid
Team. Yahaya said the items were meant for Medicaid Team to be used in
their various sensitisation programmes and interventions in the
communities towards curbing the spread of COVID-19. Responding, the governor’s wife lauded the Beach Soccer Team for
their thoughtfulness and counseled them on the need to postpone this
year’s tournament due to the pandemic. She disclosed that Medicaid Cancer Foundation had joined other
agencies and civil society organisations to sensitise residents in parts
of Kebbi and  Zamfara States, as well as FCT, Abuja. Bagudu said the foundation was distributing sanitary materials and food items to deserving citizens in those areas.
