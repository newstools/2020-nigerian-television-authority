Hoteliers under the aegis of Nigeria Hotel Association (NHA),  Nasarawa Chapter, has appealed for a N1.5 billion stimulus package from  the state government to help cushion the effects of coronavirus pandemic  on their business. Mr Abeku Danjuma, Chairman of the association made the appeal during a
courtesy visit to the Commissioner of Information, Culture and Tourism,
Mr Dogo Shammah, on Friday in Lafia. Danjuma explained that hotels in the state had been badly affected by
COVID-19 as patronage had dropped since the outbreak of the pandemic. “Our businesses were shutdown since the outbreak without customers, which means complete stoppage of our income. “The stimulus would serve as a backup to sustain the hospitality and
tourism industry from total collapse and prevent job losses,” the
Chairman added. The chairman noted that hotels in the state had contributed greatly
to youth employment, adding that supporting the industry to stay afloat
would curb restiveness. He further appealed to the government to grant the hoteliers three
years tax holiday to enable them recover from the adverse effects of the
pandemic. The Chairman said the association had directed her members not to retrench staff as a result of COVID-19. Responding, Shammah thanked the association for the visit and their contribution to the economy of the state. He said that the Gov. Abdullahi Sule led administration was willing
to  work with the association toward the development of the tourism
industry. The Commissioner explained that the government was working on a bill to reposition hotels in the state for better performance. He assured the association that their request would be forwarded to the governor for consideration.(NAN).
