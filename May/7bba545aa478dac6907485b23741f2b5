The
Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar
Malami, SAN, on Friday donated ten truckloads of assorted food stuff to
over five thousand indigent households in Kebbi. In a
joint statement issued on Friday by Dr Umar Gwandu, the Minister’s
Special Assistant on Media, the donation was made through the Khadimiyya
for Justice and Development Initiative, an NGO founded by the Minister. He
said the gesture was part of Malami’s desire to improve the living
condition of the people in line with the objectives of President
Muhammadu Buhari’s public oriented administration. “The
donation will serve as palliatives against hardship occasioned by the
Coronavirus pandemic, and also assist the less privileged members of the
society, especially in this period of Ramadan fast. “The
Minister directed that priority should be accorded to the orphans,
disabled, widows, the less privileged, religious leaders and most
vulnerable amongst the five thousand households’’. He said Malami also called on the Muslim faithful in the state to use
the blessed month of Ramadan to pray for the end of the pandemic,
peaceful co-existence and ease from the current challenges. The
items donated include 2,600 bags of rice, 1,000 bags of Sugar, 300
cartons of Spaghetti, 1,000 bags of Millet, and 1,000 gallons  of
vegetable oil. (NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.  I currently serve as I.T Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network NTA
