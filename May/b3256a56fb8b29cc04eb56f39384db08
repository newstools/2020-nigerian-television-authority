Mr Gbolahan Yishawu, member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, has
urged parents and guardians to allay fears of their children from the
ravaging Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Yishawu, representing Eti-Osa Constituency II, made the plea on
Wednesday in a goodwill message to mark the 2020 Children’s Day
celebration in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Children’s Day is an
annually event celebrated by government and non-governmental
organisations on every May 27. Yishawu, the Chairman, House Committee on Budget and Economic
Planning, assured the children that the pandemic would passed away. He said: “The impact of the COVID-19 on children cannot be ignored. For them, it has brought fear and uncertainties. “Today, as we celebrate Children’s Day, let us spend time to reassure them that this too will pass. “This is because children remain the hope, future of a brother, the symbols of promise and potential.” The lawmaker said these children might wonder why schools remained
closed, adding that it was the duty of parents to educate them on
COVID-19 and reassured them that the pandemic would end soon. He urged parents to train their children in the right way and
inculcate moral values in them to prevent them from being wayward or
constitute nuisance to the society. Yishawu noted that parents have major roles to play in the upbringing
of children, and if there was lacuna, there would be problem that could
affect the society at large. He prayed that as the world celebrate the Children’s Day, parents who  had been doing tremendous jobs, most especially in this pandemic, shall  enjoy the fruits of their labour.
