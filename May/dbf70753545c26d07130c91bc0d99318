The Minister of Power, Mr Sale Mamman, has charged the  new management of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to ensure  the timely completion of all substation and transmission projects across  the country. Mamman,  in a statement posted on his Twitter Account on  Wednesday, said he gave the charge when he received the new Acting  Managing Director of TCN, Mr Sule Abdulaziz and his team in his office  in Abuja. He said: “I met with the new management of the TCN today  after participating in the virtual Federal Executive Council meeting  which President Muhammadu Buhari presided over. ” I have charged them with ensuring all substation and transmission projects are completed within the shortest possible time. “I have also tasked them with ensuring dedicated, purposeful and selfless leadership at the TCN,” he said. He assured the team of all the necessary support and  cooperation from the ministry of power, adding that he was looking  forward to improved electricity transmission across the country. Recall that Abdulaziz was appointed TCN’s acting  Managing Director following Tuesday’s sack of the former Managing  Director, Mr Usman Mohammed. A statement by spokesman of the minister, Mr Aaron  Artimas, had said the move was part of continuing measures to reposition  and improve the performance of the power sector in the country.  Artimas said the minister also confirmed the  appointment of four directors who had been on acting position in the  company for some time.
