French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi plans to make any vaccine it develops against the novel coronavirus available to all. “The vaccine against COVID-19 will be made available to the public at
large, regardless of nationality,” the company’s director general Paul
Hudson said, according to a tweet from Sanofi France on Wednesday
evening. The message came after Hudson, in an interview with Bloomberg, said
the U.S. would have priority because they were the first in line to fund
the company’s research. “The US government has the right to the largest pre-order because it’s invested in taking the risk,” Hudson told Bloomberg. In April, Sanofi and the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline both
said they wanted to work together on a vaccine against the novel
coronavirus. If tests are successful, a vaccine could be available in the second half of 2021. Sanofi said in its Wednesday tweet that its teams are making efforts to accelerate the development of a vaccine. (dpa/NAN) Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa.
