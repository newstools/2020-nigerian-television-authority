The Niger Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has  deployed 1,159 personnel to ensure free flow of traffic during the  Eid-el-Fitr festivities in the state. The FRSC Sector Commander in the state, Mr Joel Dagwa, told the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Minna, it also deployed 24 patrol
vehicles, ambulances, one tow truck and power bike for the celebrations. He said that the personnel consisted of 659 Regular Marshals and 500
Special Marshals to effectively patrol federal highways across the
state. The sector commander explained that the operations would be aligned
with the ongoing COVID-19 Containment operations in the state. “We have since embarked on aggressive patrols at Mokwa, Magama, Rafi,
Suleja and Paikoro Local Government Areas that share borders with FCT,
Kaduna, Kebbi, Kogi and Kwara states,” he said. Dagwa said that the measure was aimed at curtailing the influx of
people into the state to prevent community spread of coronavirus. The Sector commander advised the resident to obey the restriction of
movement directives, saying it was for the collective good of all, as
only the living celebrate. He said that anyone who violates the lockdown order by embarking on
intra or interstate movement would face the wrath of the law. “We will ensure that only qualified and duly certified drivers and
vehicles ply highways during and after the festivities”, Dagwa said. The commander called on motorists in the state to desist from
speeding, wrongful and dangerous overtaking, overloading, driving under
the influence of alcohol and night journeys to avoid road accident.
