ensure smooth distribution of the palliatives. He noted that the grains consist of maize, millet and sorghum. “At the onset, the directive was for the Ministry of Humanitarian
Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development to ensure that the
grains get to 13 front line states. “But with the expansion and spread of the pandemic, there was need for us to extend to 24 states. “So in the first batch, we delivered to Ogun, Lagos, Kano and the Federal Capital Territory. “Presently, we are distributing to Zamfara, Borno and Katsina state. “So out of the 70 metric tonnes of grains which was approved for
