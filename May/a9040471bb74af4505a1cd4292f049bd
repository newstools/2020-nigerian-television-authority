An American philanthropist, Mr Jeffrey Moore, on Sunday donated food items, toiletries, hand sanitisers and cash gift to vulnerable communities to cushion the effect of the lockdown in Abuja. The philanthropist also gave money to some frontline workers, who are working to curtail the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) at the expense of their lives and families. Represented at the various communities by his wife, a Nigerian, Mrs Mary Tyrone, Moore said it was of vital importance to show compassion and lend a helping hand to all mankind and to those working hard to curb the virus. “It is with great honour and passion that I extend a helping hand to a country that has been a second home to me for many years. “The future of Nigeria is very important to me, not only is Nigeria’s future, my future, my wife and children’s future but I strongly believe that Nigeria is the future of the entire African continent. “COVID-19 is a deadly virus that has had a negative effect on the world’s population but there will always be light at the end of the tunnel and there is always a lesson to be learnt. “Nigerians are kind, loving, strong and resilient people and there is no virus on Earth that will change that. “To my friends and family in Nigeria and to all Nigerians both home and abroad stay safe, stay healthy and continue to be great,” he said. Moore, however, enjoined all spirited individuals both home and abroad to come to the aid of vulnerable Nigerians, especially at this time of lockdown. Mr Joseph Dauda, a youth leader in Kabusa community, expressed appreciation of the people of the village to the philanthropist for coming to their aid at this critical period. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that communities that benefited from the gesture includes Karmajiji, Kabusa and Gudu. NAN Tanimu is an Online Editor with Africa's Largest TV Network.
