lockdown period avails us the opportunity to improve our teachers. For
instance, we partnered with Microsoft and they are teaching 18,000 of
our teachers on digital literacy. “So, they are going to come out of this
training, being able to work comfortably with Word and Excel which is
going to be done through the Zoom App because of the social distancing
order. “So, first of all, they are learning to be computer literate straightaway.” According to her, computer literacy is of
importance at this point when technology is evolving for the
advancement of teaching and learning processes. Adefisayo added that the introduction of
Eko Excel Programme, which was part of the administration’s THEMES
agenda, had improved the teaching and learning experiences in classroom
between the teachers and pupils. She added that the government and private
sector were investing in online teaching and learning at this trying
times, saying devices were being given to students for online learning. “We have continued to call for devices
and people have continued to give us, we are going to start giving them
out within a week. Parents will be excited,” she said. The commissioner said the online digital
class would not be stopped after the pandemic, saying it would be used
to reinforce teaching and learning. According to her, the ministry is at the
final stage of recruitment processes for 2,000 teachers in order to
boost the standard of public primary school education in the state. Adefisayo said the government, through
the ministry, was looking at employing teachers every quarter, saying
the rate of retirement of teachers was very high in Lagos. She said the Sanwo-Olu’s administration had granted the ministry permission to replace retired teachers. “The most important aspect of learning is
the quality of teachers and we did not have enough teachers to
actualise the set plan for learning in our public schools,” she said. On school resumption, the commissioner,
who noted that the ministry could not give the exact resumption date,
said the government was watching the trend of the pandemic. “We cannot say specifically that we are
going to open on so and so date. We are also working with the federal
government because it is not a decision that any state can take
unilaterally. “We are looking at the pandemic. The main
thing for us is safety first, safety second, safety third. If we are
certain that our children are fairly safe, we will open school,” she
said. On whether there were plans to put
COVID-19 school safety protocols in place and ensure strict adherence
when the school finally reopened, Adefisayo said the ministry was
already working on a paper on this. She said the ministry was working with
the Federal Ministry of Education, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control,
Development Agencies and others to develop a very robust protocol paper
for school to reopen. “Whenever we say the school will start,
there will be notice, there will be time for preparations. We are going
to have time within which schools will be able to put in place those
protocols for children’s safety. “Office of the Education Quality Assurance is working hard with us to ensure compliance,” she added. According to her, considering the
dynamism of the society needs, the government has also embarked on
training of experts/corricullum developers that will fine-tune the
curriculum towards preparing students in compliance with current
societal needs. (NAN) The commissioner said: “This COVID-19  lockdown period avails us the opportunity to improve our teachers. For  instance, we partnered with Microsoft and they are teaching 18,000 of  our teachers on digital literacy. “So, they are going to come out of this
