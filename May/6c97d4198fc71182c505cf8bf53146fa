The Yobe government, on Wednesday, flagged off distribution of food  items to 5,750 vulnerable households across the 17 local government  areas of the state to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown. Dr Ali Abbas, the state Focal Person and Coordinator of North-East  Development Commission (NEDC), who flagged off the distribution in  Gashua, Bade Local Government area, said that the palliatives were also  for Eid-El Fitr celebrations. “Today, we are here in Gashua to distribute palliatives as Ramadan and sallah packages for the vulnerable groups in the society. “This programme marks a statewide flag-off of the distribution of these food items to 5,750 direct beneficiaries,” Abbas said. He added that the items were meant to ease the effects of the lockdown on the people. The coordinator listed the food items to include rice, beans, maize flour, tomato paste, seasoning, vegetable oil and spaghetti. Abbas appealed to the beneficiaries to pray for the success of the Gov. Mai Mala Buni-led administration. In his remarks, Alhaji Kabiru Maimota, a lawmaker representing Bade East  constituency at the state House of Assembly, commended the state  government for the intervention. “The palliatives will cushion the sufferings of our people during this  trying moment of coronavirus pandemic as well as Ramadan and sallah  festivities,” the lawmaker said. Also, a centenarian, Madam Ya-Zara Sulaiman, who betrayed emotion,  praised the governor for the palliatives made available to the  vulnerable and the less-privileged. “May Allah bless our governor for his kind gesture and recognition,” she said.
