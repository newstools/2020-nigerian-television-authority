President Muhammadu Buhari is presiding over the meeting of the
National Security Council with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the
Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha in
attendance. Also in attendance are security and service chiefs as well as some
cabinet members, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Geoffrey
Onyeama. The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice,
Abubakar Malami and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Ra’uf Aregbesola
are also attending. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reliably gathered that the meeting
would deliberate on national issues, including the impact of COVID-19
pandemic on the nation’s security architecture. NAN also learnt that the meeting would be updated on the various
successes being recorded in the fight against insurgency, banditry and
other violent crimes across the country. The leader of the outlawed Boko Haram sect, Abubakar Shekau, was in
an audio clip on Tuesday crying and begging for help, following the
intensified attacks on his members by the Nigerian soldiers in the
battle fields. ”In a new audio, the leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, is no longer sounding pompous, but he is now crying like a baby. ”He also seeks Allah’s protection for him and his rag-tag terror gang
from the firepower of the Nigerian military,” an online outfit reported
on Wednesday. NAN reports that today’s meeting of the national security council is
the first since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in the country. (NAN) Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
