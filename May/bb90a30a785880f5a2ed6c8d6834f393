The Operation Hadarin Daji Air Component in continuation of the renewed  onslaught against armed bandits in parts of the North West and North  Central States, has  destroyed a banditsâ€™ logistics warehouse approximately 5Km North of  Birnin Kogo in Zamfara State. The Coordinator Media Operations, Defence Headquarters, Major Gen. John Enenche disclosed this in a press release. He said that the air strikes were executed yesterday,  30 May 2020, sequel to Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports, which were  later confirmed by series of aerial surveillance missions, indicating  that the large structure was being used by the bandits to store their  ammunition, raw rations and other logistics items. Accordingly, the Air Component dispatched a Nigerian Air Force (NAF)  attack aircraft to engage the target scoring accurate hits on the  warehouse, which went up in flames as a result of its volatile contents,  leading to its complete destruction. Four armed bandits guarding the  facility were also neutralized as a result of the attack. The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar,  commends the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI for their  professionalism and directs them to remain resolute in the conduct of  air strikes whilst continuing to provide close air support for ongoing  ground operations in order to eradicate all armed bandits; thus  achieving the directives of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) to restore  normalcy in the North West and North Central Zones of the Country.
