“Despite our political differences, the late President Yar’adua was unarguably a patriot because of his passion for the masses and his reversal of policies he believed were hurting ordinary Nigerians. Every leader should be given the credit that he deserves, whether you agree with President Yar’adua politically or not, I must say that history will always record his honest and sincere service to the country. As we remember President Yar’adua today, let us emulate his patience and gentle nature so that we don’t introduce toxicity into our politics where opponents perceive each other as enemies. Let me also use this occasion to extend my prayers and goodwill to his family, and Katsina State Government on the 10th anniversary of his demise. May Allah continue to bless and comfort his gentle soul.” Muhammadu Buhari President, Federal Republic of Nigeria Tanimu is an Online Editor with Africa's Largest TV Network.
