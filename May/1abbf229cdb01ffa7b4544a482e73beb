Gentlemen of the press, good afternoon This morning, I performed the virtual inauguration of the Committee on Post-Covid-19-Initiatives for the Creative Industry. If you recollect, I announced the establishment of the committee two weeks ago, when I met with members of the Broadcasting Organizations of Nigeria (BON). The Committee comprises 22 members drawn from the various sectors of the Creative Industry. The number of members increased from the 14 that was initially announced to 22, as we brought in more sectoral representatives. The Committee is to:- assess the expected impact of the pandemic on the industry in general; advise the Government on how to mitigate job and revenue losses in the sector as well as to create succour for the industry small businesses;  Suggest the type of taxation and financing that is best for the industry at this time to encourage growth and advise the Government on any other measure or measures that can be undertaken to support the industry. The establishment of the committee was necessitated by the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Creative Industry, which is very key to the nation’s economy and also a major plank of the economic diversification policy of this Administration. Yes, every industry is affected by the pandemic, but the Creative Industry, being audience-centred, has particularly been hardest hit. Though I had given the committee four weeks to submit its report, it requested for an additional week, during today’s inauguration, and I granted the extension. I look forward to the committee’s recommendations which I believe will help the industry to rebound, post-Covid-19. I thank you for your kind attention Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.
