Gov. Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe has directed civil servants on Grade  Levels 9 and above to resume work with effect from Monday May 25. The governor who gave the directive in a statewide broadcast in Gombe
on Friday, urged the workers to endeavour to heed to health guidelines
for the prevention of coronavirus. Yahaya equally announced a review of the curfew time in the state to
between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. daily which accordingly would take effect from
today. He maintained that congregational gatherings should be between 20 and
50 persons and called on the people of the state to take responsibility
in the fight against coronavirus through strict observance to social
distancing and other health directives. The governor also said that the state government would extend
palliatives to 66,000 most vulnerable households, adding that the move
was to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on most
vulnerable persons in the state. According to Yahaya, my administration is aware of the economic and
social impacts of COVID-19 on the people as a result of measures imposed
by the government to contain community transmission of the disease. “We shall embark on the distribution of our palliatives, targeting 30
most vulnerable households in all 2,218 polling units across the state
which translates to about 66,000 households or 400,000 individuals.” He explained that government decided to relax the restrictions due to
the consequences on the economic and social lives of the people who
were mostly farmers. (NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.  I currently serve as I.T Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network NTA
