The Madrid regional government on Friday announced plans to set up a
5,500-bed hospital on convention centre land as the number of
Coronavirus cases rose 16 per cent to hit 20,000, with the number of
deaths passing 1,000. Fernando Simon, head of the CCAES emergency health service said
Madrid has the bulk of the countryâ€™s cases, with more than 7,000, with
Catalonia in second place, with more than 3,000. The emergency clinic will be set up on land belonging to the Ifema convention centre on the outskirts of Madrid. It will be equipped to treat patients needing intensive care. The country is about halfway through a 15-day lockdown designed to
slow the march of the Coronavirus, which has spread worldwide since
appearing in China late 2019. Authorities say they hope that infections will soon top off and that the spread of the virus will slow.
