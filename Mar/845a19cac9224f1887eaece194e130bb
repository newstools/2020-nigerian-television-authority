President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday, met behind closed doors with
governors elected under the platform of the All Progressives Congress
(APC) at the State House, Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the agenda of the meeting was unknown as at the time filing this report. However, Gov. Atiku Bagudu, who led the governors to the meeting with
Buhari, announced the postponement of the APC National Executive
Committee meeting earlier scheduled for Tuesday. Bagudu, who spoke with State House correspondents at the end of the
meeting, said the postponement was at the instance of the governors. NAN reports that the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi
Gbajabiamila, had earlier met with the president behind closed doors at
the State House. NAN reliably learnt that the meeting between the president and
Gbajabiamila was centred on the APC leadership crisis and the proposed
22.7 billion dollars loan as it affects all the six geo-political zones,
particularly the South East. (NAN) Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
