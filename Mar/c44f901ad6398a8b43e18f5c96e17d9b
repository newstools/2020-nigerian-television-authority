The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said it is aware of media reports stating that Director General of the centre, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu is in  ‚Äòquarantine over coronavirus‚Äô. This is false. This was stated in a press release issued by the NCDC on its website. It said Between the 16th and 24th of February 2020, the World Health  Organization deployed a high-level mission to China. The joint mission  had 25 national and international experts, including the Director  General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu.  He also made this known via his Twitter account I am well and have continued my duties from home since my return from China as part of the WHO-China Mission on #COVID19 The rumour that I am sick or in quarantine is obviously false. I look forward to returning to the office after 14 days of self-isolation üòÅ pic.twitter.com/sigfoARVfK ‚Äî Chikwe Ihekweazu (@Chikwe_I) March 3, 2020   The Mission met with counterparts in China to understand their response  to COVID-19 and how the global community can learn from this. As  recommended in NCDC‚Äôs public health advisory, travelers from countries  with ongoing transmission of COVID-19 are advised to proceed on 14-day  self-isolation, whether well or unwell. The Director General has adhered to this, to protect himself and the public. He has been tested since his return, and has shown no symptoms  of COVID-19 infection. He remains in good health. The Honourable Minister of Health is very proud of Dr Ihekweazu‚Äôs
contribution, which reflects the high-level recognition and respect the
global health community has for Nigeria. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
