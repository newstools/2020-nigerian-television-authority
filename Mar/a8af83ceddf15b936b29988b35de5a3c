The Niger Government is soliciting for support in terms  of funding, kits, drugs and other logistics to combat the spread of  Coronavirus  (COVID-19) in the state. The government urged the people of the state,  philanthropists and corporate organisations to donate generously to the  state COVID-19 Intervention Appeal Fund. It made the appeal in a statement issued by the  Secretary to the State Government (SSG) and Chairman, Niger State Task  Force on COVID-19, Alhaji Ahmed Matane, on Saturday in Minna. Matane said that the donations would go a long way in  augmenting the capacity of the state government to contain the pandemic  across the state. He explained that the donations would also assist  government to fund medical centres, provide manpower and necessary  materials essential to arrest the spread of Coronavirus in the state. “We must rise and unite to fight this common enemy as we see a rapid increase of COVID-19 in other place,” he said. The task force chairman stated that government had made  tremendous effort in the fight against the pandemic, and enjoined the  people to complement the efforts made by government in fighting the  pandemic. “COVID-19 continues to spiral upward in some countries  around the world, but with the support of all and sundry, the  containment of the disease remains possible in the state,” he said. Matane said that the Niger State COVID-19 Intervention  Appeal Fund account was domiciled in United Bank for Africa (UBA) with  number 1022751730 and Sort Code 033163189.
