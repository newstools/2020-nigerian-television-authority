The Nigeria bourse has lost N1.87 trillion to global oil price crash and increasing spread of COVID-19 in four days. Specifically, the market capitalisation, which opened trading for the
week at N13.694 trillion, shed N1.87 trillion or 13.63 per cent, having

dropped 3,583.73 points or 13.64 per cent in four days to close trading
on Thursday at 22,695.88. Malam Garba Kurfi, the Managing Director, APT Securities and Funds
Ltd., attributed the development to crash in crude oil price leading to
review of 2020 budget. Kurfi added that increasing spread of COVID-19 was another source of
worry to investors with the World Health Organisation describing the
viral disease as pandemic. “The market crash was as a result of the fear of devaluation by foreign investors who are willing to sale at whatever price. “Being major players in the market, we need to manage it,” Kurfi said. He stressed the need to review some market policies, noting that margin loan was important at the very moment to minimise loss. An analysis of trading on Thursday shows that MTN Nigeria recorded
