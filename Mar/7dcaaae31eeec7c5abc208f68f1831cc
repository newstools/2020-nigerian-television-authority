The federal government has ordered civil servants in the Federal Civil Service from grade level 12 and below to start working from home effective from Tuesday, March 24, as the country intensifies efforts to curb the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country. The Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Folashade Yemi-Esan, issued the directive in a memo titled “Compulsory Stay At Home Of Non-Essential Public Servants On GL Grade 12 And Below As A Further Measure To Curtail The Spread Of Covid-19.” In the memo marked “HCSF/109/S.l/1/10023rd March, 2020”, the federal government said it was is concerned about the welfare and safety of Nigerians, hence the need to protect them from the virus. The memo said, “As a further step to check the spread of COVID-19, all non-essential public servants on grade level 12 and below are to work from home with effect from Tuesday 24th March, 2020 until further notice. “All other categories of officers who will be at work, are strongly advised to limit the number of visitors they receive to the barest minimum. This is to reduce physical contact as much as possible. “Furthermore, officers who have recently visited countries with incidence of COVID — 19 or, have had contact with persons who recently returned from these countries, are advised to self-isolate at home for 2 weeks. In case such officers exhibit any of the COVID 19 symptoms, they are advised to contact the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on 0800970000 — 10.” The federal government urged Nigerians to observe strict adherence to personal hygiene, including frequent washing of hands with soap and running water.
