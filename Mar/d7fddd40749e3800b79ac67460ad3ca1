The deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, has left Awe, Nasarawa State, his abode after he left Kano on Monday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that Sanusi left Awe at  about 4:27 p.m., in company of Gov Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna, after  observing the Friday congregational prayers. Sanusi had led the Friday Juma’at prayer at the Awe Central Mosque,
where he admonished Muslims to take whatever situation they found
themselves in, as destiny. He encouraged the faithful to always live with the fear of God and
accept whatever predicament that befell them in good faith, and prayed
for the peace and development of the country. NAN reports that Hajiya Saudatu Hussain, the aged mother of the Emir, had arrived Awe on Friday morning, to meet her son. Efforts to confirm Sanusi’s destination did not yield fruits, but an
authoritative source told NAN that the former monarch left Awe “to enjoy
his freedom”. “You remember that a Federal High Court in Abuja gave an odrer
directing his immediate release from confinement. The man is now free
and should be allowed to be free,” he said. NAN recalls that the Kano government had dethroned Sanusi on Monday,
March 9, over alleged open disregard to the state government and
disrespect for the traditions of the Kano Emirate. He was initially taken to Loko in Nasarawa State, before he was moved
to Awe, another town in the north-central state, on Wednesday, March
11. ((NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.  I currently serve as I.T Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network NTA
