Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River has recalled workers of the state-  owned Garment Factory back to work, for the mass production of face and  nose masks. The workers are to resume work on March 31 after the factory had been disinfected. The workers were initially sent home in line with the partial lock
down declared by the governor as a precautionary measure against the
spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking at the Industrial Park, Ayade told newsmen on Monday in
Calabar that it has become imperative for the Garment Factory workers to
return to work in view of the urgency of the need to tackle the deadly
virus headlong. “The Garment Factory workers are being recalled for mass production of nose/mouth masks in order to stem the pandemic. “As the workers return to start mass production of the masks, we will
ensure that they keep a reasonable distance from one another in keeping
with the industrial distancing protocol”, he said. Ayade disclosed that proper fumigation of the factory has been carried out preparatory to the resumption of the workers. According to the governor, the returning Garment Factory workers will
be properly kitted to ensure that they are fit for the purpose in
addition to being paid special allowances. “Working at this time when there is a general shut down requires a special compensation. The Garment factory workers will be fairly compensated”, he said. The governor disclosed that precautionary measures will also entail that the number of workers being recalled are manageable. Ayade said he was equally activating the Cross River State Food Bank
to ensure that food is delivered to most vulnerable in view of the lock
down. (NAN) Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services. Henry is also proficient in use of most online journalism tools and Social media management. He currently serve as Information Technology Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network.
