A faith-based Organisation, Universal Mercy Fellowship has  distributed food items to the less privileged in Calabar South Local  Government Area (LGA) of Cross River. Speaking with journalists on Tuesday at the ceremony, President of the  organisation, Miss Ronke Aluko, said that the gesture was aimed at  cushioning the effect of the current lockdown on the less privileged in  the society. “We are an international welfare and humanitarian organisation with  members around the world, we had to pull our resources together to, at  least, help in our little way to support the people with some food  items. ”We are aware of what many households, especially the less endowed
ones, will go through during this lockdown, this is why we want to
cushion the effect of the 14 days restriction order,”Aluko said. Similarly, Secretary of the organisation, Bishop Joseph Johnson, said
they would continue with the food distribution once they were able to
gather more resources. One of the beneficiaries, Mrs Angelina Ukpong, said the organisation
has done well to extend the food items to her in particular, and other
less privileged people. Sixty two year old Ukpong, said she had three grand children living with her and had ran out of food supplies a day before. “In the markets now, prices of food items have risen as a result of
the corona virus that is reported to be killing people, may God bless
the efforts of this group. “I want to also call on other organisations, churches and public
spirited individuals to assist the people and the state government to
fight the virus, we are happy that it has not entered our state,”she
said. (NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.  I currently serve as I.T Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network NTA
