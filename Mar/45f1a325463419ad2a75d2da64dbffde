The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has obliterated a terrorists’ camp at Alafa ‘C’ in the heart of Sambisa forest in Borno. Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, NAF Director of Public Relations and
Information, who made this known in a statement on Friday in Abuja,
said the operation was conducted on Thursday. Daramola said that the operation was conducted through the Air Task
Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE under the auspices of Operation
DECISIVE EDGE. He explained that the attack was undertaken following confirmatory
Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions which
established that several compounds in the settlement were being used by
the terrorists to house and train their fighters. ” The bomb strikes and rocket salvos from the ATF’s fighter jets hit
the designated compounds, obliterating most of the structures and
neutralising some of the BHT occupants,”  he said. Daramola asserted that NAF, operating in concert with surface forces,
would sustain its air campaigns against the terrorists’ hideouts to
shape the battle space for the effective conduct of further ground and
air operations. Operation DECISIVE EDGE was a new air interdiction operation which
was initiated to specifically target known Boko Haram Terrorists
hideouts that were inaccessible to ground forces due to the terrain as
well as the fact that the ground routes to the locations were heavily
mined. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services. Henry is also proficient in use of most online journalism tools and Social media management. He currently serve as Information Technology Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network.
