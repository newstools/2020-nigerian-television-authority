The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has warned fleet operators who
tamper with the calibrated Speed Limiting Devices (SLD) in their
vehicles for economic benefits to desist or face the consequences. The Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement
by the Corps Public Education Officer, Mr Bisi Kazeem, on Wednesday in
Abuja. Oyeyemi warned such operators to desist or risk confiscation of their
vehicles and subsequent compulsory re-installation and calibration of
such speed limiters. He frowned at the dangerous act and directed Zonal Commanding
Officers, Sector Commanders and Unit Commanders across the country to
impound any vehicle caught in the act. “These elements engage in such deadly acts for economic gains. They
speed beyond the prescribed legal speed limit to make more trips within a
short time at the detriment of the lives of their passengers and other
road users. “The perpetrators want to ridicule the achievement recorded by the Corps since the commencement of enforcement on the device. “But the Corps will not allow such to prevail as tactical strategies
have been put in place to impound such vehicles and make the drivers
face the law accordingly. “I have directed Commanding officers to impound all vehicles
suspected to have altered the device in their vehicles and ensure that
such vehicles re-calibrate the device before the vehicles are released
and we shall be very strict and swift on this,” he said. The Corps Marshal reiterated that FRSC identified speeding as a major
contributory factor to road crashes and attendant casualties in the
country. He called on the public to always tune into the National Traffic
Radio (NTR) 107.1FM to report any suspected case of speeding,
obstruction or any emergency noticed on the road for immediate action. Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
