) The Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) says there is no
Lassa fever patient in its health centre contrary to report being
circulated on the social media. Mr Adebanjo Adegbenro, the Deputy Director of Corporate
Communication, FUTA, denied the rumour of patients with the fever in the
institution’s health facility in a statement on Monday in Akure. “We want to debunk unfounded rumour captioned “Lassa Fever Hits FUTA Health Centre,” being spread on the social media. “The rumour is unfounded, baseless and false in its entirety. “FUTA health centre is not a diagnostic or treatment bay for Lassa
fever and as such does not harbour patients of the ailment or persons
undergoing investigations relating to it,’’ Adegbero said. According to him, the institution has taken proactive measures to
educate students, staff and the school community on the nature and
presentations of the disease and its preventive measures. “The enlightenment programme is still ongoing as the health centre
continues its collaboration with other relevant heath authorities and
stakeholders in the fight to curtail the spread and eventual eradication
of the dreaded disease in the country. “It should be clear that the Lassa fever outbreak in the country is a
serious health challenge and unfounded rumour or scare mongering will
be counterproductive,’’ he stated.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.
