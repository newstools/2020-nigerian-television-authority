One person has been confirmed dead in an attempt to kidnap Dr. Mike
Dio-Jen, the Provost of Taraba College of Education Zing, at his
residence in Jalingo. The incident occurred in the early hours of Friday, at the Green Beach area of Kona ward, in Jalingo. An eye witness who spoke under anonymity told the News Agency of
Nigeria(NAN), that the kidnappers who came in their numbers, fired
several gunshots at the gate of the provost’s house and forced their way
in. They however, met stiff resistance by security operatives, guarding
the provost’s house and this led to the death of the gate man of the
house while the kidnappers fled the area through a nearby river The remains of the slain gate man, Mr Shawulu Yeshi, who was a staff
of the college, have been deposited at the morgue of Federal Medical
Centre, in Jalingo. The Police spokesman in Taraba, ASP David Misal, confirmed the incident, saying the police were investigating  the case. Misal added that the police would do their best to see that crime was nipped in the bud in the state. NAN reports that, in spite of the enactment of the anti-kidnapping  prohibition law signed by Gov. Darius Ishaku, the menace is still  prevailing unabated.
