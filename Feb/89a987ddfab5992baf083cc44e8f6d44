dollars directly to more than 1,000 associations which had impacted four
million lives in Africa. “USADF has been active in Nigeria since 2001 and in the last 10
years, it has invested more than 100 million dollars while hundreds
entrepreneurs at the grassroots are growing. “In Kebbi, we have invested 10 million dollars in the five years MoU

agribusinesses,” he said. Glin said that the grants given to the beneficiaries were
conditionally attached to improving lives of the people, adding that the
states such as Kano, Kaduna and Benue had been partnering with the
agency. “Kebbi is leading the way to increasing USADF investment in Nigeria. “From Lagos to Niger to FCT, you are leading the way. They want to be like Kebbi.” The president said that USADF considered the state for the investment
because of its needs, leadership and possible momentum, while
commending the government for its commitment in improving the lives of
the people. The Executive Director, Diamond Development Initiatives (DDI), Mr
Adamu Garba said that 10,000 people would benefit from the eight
approved proposals for funding support after a rigorous design and
compliance review process by the USADF team in Washington DC. “The eight cooperative associations whose proposals were approved are
largely apex associations comprising over 70 affiliate cooperative
societies with a combined membership base of over 1,600 smallholder
farmers, herders, processors and marketers among who are women and
youths. “We have estimated that the eight projects of two rice, two diary and
four groundnuts will positively impact over 10,000 persons as the
association will receive funds for procurement of all the required farm
inputs. “All the projects have successfully taken off with initial start-up
activities as the staff of each of the cooperatives has received
training on USADF accounting policies, procedures and reporting
requirements to ensure effective and judicious management of the project
funds,” he said. Garba said that the goal was to first of all, encourage the
participating farmer associations to see agriculture as a business
rather than as a subsistence activity. “The project is expected to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in the beneficiaries. “Overall, this is expected to engender an inclusive economic growth in the target communities and the state at large,” he said. He said that after an extensive review process of the applications
and proposals by the members of the Programme Consultative Committee
(PCC), three commodity value chains were targeted under programme. “These are rice, groundnut and dairy.” He said that the DDI would provide timely and quality support to
grantees in implementing the projects in accordance with the terms of
the grant agreements and to achieve established performance targets. “In addition, DDI will assist the grantees in forming and
operationalising a performance monitoring committee, including providing
initial training to the group in participatory performance monitoring,”
the director said. Gov. Atiku Bagudu described the investment in Nigeria as greater value chains, saying it would go beyond the amount. He said that the people of the state were hardworking, dedicated, waiting for experts to lead them to success. “We are selling rice to Lagos State, it can be done too by selling rice to New York City, Washington DC. “With this opportunity, it will create more opportunities for our people; more income for them and prosperity, ”  Bagudu said.
