President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned Boko Haram attack on Garkida
in Adamawa State, and extended his sympathy to families of victims. In a statement by his spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on
Sunday, the President said that no part of Nigeria would be abandoned to
their fate. He said: “These attacks on soft targets by the terrorists are obvious
signs of frustration because my administration has significantly
weakened Boko Haram’s military capability to invade and hold Nigerian
territory unchallenged. “Our gallant forces deserve our appreciation for repelling the
attackers but they must go beyond this point. They have our full support
to go after the terrorists and have them pay a huge price. ”I want to assure the country that terrorists will continue to face
the combined power of our military until they give up their mistaken
ways. “These occasional and episodic attacks on poor civilians by the
terrorists are mere propaganda efforts to portray them as strong in
order to fool the public into believing that they haven’t been
militarily weekend by our gallant troops.” President Buhari said since the inception of his administration, Boko
Haram’s ability to invade and occupy Nigerian territories, let alone be
able to hoist their flags had been frustrated. President Buhari assured that in the coming weeks Nigerians would
witness an aggressive campaign to rout Boko Haram once and for all. “Security will continue to be well funded despite the competing needs of social services. ”I appeal to Nigerians to continue to support our troops in their
gallant efforts to protect the citizens and secure the country,” he
added. Innocent Korie is an ICT and Project Management Professional with very good flair in  business development,  and Online media management.
