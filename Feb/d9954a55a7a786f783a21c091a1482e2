Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) on Friday said  it had put in place  necessary protocols at the ports as safeguard against the dreaded  Coronavirus disease. The Managing Director of NPA, Ms Hadiza Bala-Usman, disclosed this to newsmen on the sidelines of a book presentation in Lagos. According to her, once a vessel carrying yellow flag is sighted by the harbor master, port health will be immediately notified. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that yellow flag (contagion)
is historically displayed on ships to indicate the presence of disease
or quarantine. “Once port health is notified, the vessel will be taken to a separate
location where there will be immediate health assessment before anyone
or cargo will be allowed to disembark,” she said. The NPA boss said they were very conscious of the virus and had been
in several interactions with the Federal Ministry of Health. She pointed out that the NPA would continue to monitor and enlighten people, as it was a very serious issue. “NPA is very mindful of its responsibility as the gateway to the
nation’s economy and will do everything possible to protect the
economy,” she said. The managing director said that visitors and staff were also checked
at the gate of the NPA office complex to ensure  they were free from any
form of illness.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.  I currently serve as I.T Officer with Africa's Largest TV Network NTA
