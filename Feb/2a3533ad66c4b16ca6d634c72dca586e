The Governing Board of the National Examinations Council (NECO) has
approved the dismissal of 19 staff from service for certificate forgery. NECO Head, Information and Public Relations, Mr Azeez Sani said this in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday. Sani said that the dismissed staff were uncovered by Staff Certificate Verification Committee constituted by the Management. “The Staff Certificate Verification Committee constituted by the
Management carried out its assignment diligently by inviting some staff
with questionable credentials to appear before it,” he said. He said that during the exercise, the affected staff attested that their certificates were forged. “The committee also contacted the schools and institutions which the
affected staff claimed to have attended and the schools and institutions
denied having certificated them. “At its 52nd regular meeting, the Governing Board of the Council
vetted the report of the Certificate Verification Committee and approved
the dismissal of the affected staff,” he said. Sani added that the Governing Board had at its 17th Extra Ordinary
meeting in November 2019, also approved the dismissal of 70 staff for
certificate forgery. He said that the ongoing certificate verification was aimed at sanitising the system.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.
