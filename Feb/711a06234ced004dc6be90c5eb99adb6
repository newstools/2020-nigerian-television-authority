when we wear hijab,” she said.“We created hashtag hijab story on Instagram telling

difficulties wearing hijab.“We received 46 videos and three ladies were selected and given gifts to round off the world hijab day,” she said.She said NASFAT also visited schools across the country to sensitise the girls on the need to wear hijab.She said NASFAT would continue to sensitise the public most especially Muslims on the importance of wearing hijab.“It is in the Qur’an and we must obey Allah so we will continue to sensitise the public,” she said.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the hijab day is celebrated every Feb. 1.Series of activies to commemorate the event by NASFAT ended on Feb. 23.
