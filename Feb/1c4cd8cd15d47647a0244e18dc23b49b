France has recorded the first death of a French citizen from the new
Coronavirus (Covid-19), the countryâ€™s general director of health Jerome
Salomon says. The victim was a 60-year-old Frenchman who was tested for the disease
on Tuesday night at a Paris hospital in a very serious condition and
died overnight, Salomon said. Including the dead man, three new cases were identified overnight
bringing the total number of diagnosed infections with the new
coronavirus to 17, he salmon. One of the other two was coming back from the northern Italian region of Piedmont. Salomon said further information would be available this evening. An 80-year old Chinese tourist also died from Covid-19 in France
earlier this month, the first fatality on European soil. (dpa//NAN) Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
