Gov. Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe state has felicitated with the Christian
community on the occasion of this year’s Easter celebration while urging
compliance with government’s directives on social distancing. Speaking through Mr Ismaila Misilli, his Senior Special Assistant on
Media and Publicity, the governor, said  the celebration came when the
world was going through difficult times occasioned by the coronavirus
pandemic. “As you celebrate the Easter, I call on you to be mindful and observe  the COVID-19 protocols of social distancing, hand sanitizing and other  protective and preventive measures,” he advised, just as he pledged his  determination to protect the people. “ Although there is no recorded case of coronavirus in the state,
government has taken necessary steps and put measures in place for the
containment of the dreaded global pandemic and mitigation of its
impact,’’ he said. While calling on faithful to pray for continuous peace and stability,
Yahaya said the season provided an opportunity for unity of purpose,
reinforcement of bond of brotherhood and dedication in service to God
and humanity. ” I also call on you to continue to pray fervently against the
COVID-19 pandemic that is threatening humanity and its means of
livelihood”. “We are indeed in a trying moment but I am optimistic that with
collective commitment, sacrifice and by turning to God through prayers,
we shall overcome the trial and emerge stronger,” he added.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of  online journalism tools & Social media management.
