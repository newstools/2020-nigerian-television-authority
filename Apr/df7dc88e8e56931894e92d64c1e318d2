Pursuant to the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari to some critical sectors of the Government to provide maximum support for the fight against the Covid-19 malaise, the Federal Ministry of Power has completed the installation of solar powered mini grids in some isolation centers across the country to provide 24 hours electricity supply to the centers. The solar plants were effectively installed within a short period of time by the Rural Electricity Agency, REA, following the instructions of the Minister of Power, Engr. Sale Mamman. The fully installed solar hybrid projects are; 53.1kwp solar mini grid at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital Covid-19 isolation center, 25kwp mini grid at the National Center for Disease control public health laboratory in Lagos, 20kwp solar hybrid mini grid at the 128-bed Ikenne isolation center and the 10kwp mini grid at the 100-bed Iberekodo isolation center in Ogun state. The Minister of Power, Engr. Sale Mamman explained that the ministry swung into action through the Rural Electricity Agency to ensure constant and uninterrupted power supply to the centers for the effective fight against the Coronavirus. He said the mini grid solar powered plants will provide clean, safe and reliable power to avail Health workers a conducive environment to maximize their efforts while providing the patients with an excellent atmosphere to recuperate. The NCDC which has since taken control of the facilities applauded both REA and the Federal Ministry of Power for the gesture, saying that it would go a long way to assist in curtailing the spread of the Corona virus in Nigeria.
