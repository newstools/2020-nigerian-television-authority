Pope  Francis on Friday issued a special video message calling on people  around the world not to lose faith and to comfort each other through the  novel coronavirus pandemic. “It is a hard moment for all of us. For many, very hard. The pope
knows it, and through these words, he wants to express his closeness and
affection to everyone,” he said, speaking in Italian. He urged people “to make the best use of this time” by being
“generous” and helping those in need, even by reaching out to the
loneliest “via phone or social media”. “Even if we are isolated, thought and spirit can go far with the
creativity of love,” Francis, the leader of the world’s 1.3 billion
Catholics, said. He mentioned the elderly, the homeless, prisoners, bereaved families,
those worried about losing their jobs and the “heroes” working in
hospitals or providing essential services to societies. The pope, who is 83, no longer appears in public due to the pandemic,
and will lead Easter celebrations next week with no congregation –
something unprecedented in modern times. “We will celebrate Holy Week in a truly unusual way,” he said. Easter, the most important Christian holiday, marks the resurrection
of Jesus Christ. And faith “in the risen Jesus” should give people hope,
the pontiff said. “It is the hope for better times, in which we can be better ourselves, finally freed from evil and from this pandemic. “It is a hope: hope does not disappoint, it is not an illusion,” Francis said.
