The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, affirmed Ahmadu Fintri of the Peoples
Democratic Party, (PDP), as the validly elected governor of Adamawa
State. Members of the court’s seven-man panel led by Justice Olabode
Rhodes-Vivour, were unanimous in dismissing the appeals by the candidate
of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the last governorship
election. The apex court held that the  APC and its candidate, Jibrilla Bindow,
failed to prove their allegation that Fintri emerged through
over-voting. Justice Dattijo Mohammed, who read the lead judgment in the appeal in  relation to the Adamawa case, held that the appellants failed to prove  their case.(NAN) Innocent Korie is an ICT and Project Management Professional with very good flair in  business development,  and Online media management.
