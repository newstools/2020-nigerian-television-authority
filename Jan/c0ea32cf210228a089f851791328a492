The police in Jos on Tuesday arrested four cattle herders; Hamisu
Mohammed, 18, Rayanu Mohammed, 15, Mustapha Yunusa, 15, and Abbas
Salisu, 17, for allegedly raping four female minors. The suspects, all of Manger Village in Bokkos Local Government Area
of Plateau, are being held for rape at the state Criminal Investigation
Division. The charge sheet said, the suspects in the course of tending to their
flock in the bush, accosted the sisters who were on their way home and
raped them. According to the statement from one of the victims, she said; she and
her 3 sisters were walking home when the ‘Fulani’ boys accosted them
and threatened them with sticks. She said when they tried to resist them; the boys beat them with the
sticks, injured them and later took turns to rape all of them. She added that after the rape, she and her sisters ran to a nearby
Village called Luwapam and raised alarm after which the boys got
arrested by villagers. The suspects, in their statement to the police, admitted to raping
the sisters stating that they all conspired to rape the girls. One of the suspects, Hamisu Mohammed, stated in his statement, that
they were ‘sexually charged’ on sighting the girls and so immediately
resorted to raping them as there was nothing they could do at that
moment to ease their urge. The police prosecutor, Insp. E.A Inegbenoise, who confirmed the
arrest, said that the suspects had already been charged and would soon
appear in court. (NAN) Innocent Korie is an ICT and Project Management Professional with very good flair in  business development,  and Online media management.
