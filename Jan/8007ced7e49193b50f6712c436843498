The governor-elect of Imo State, Sen. Hope Uzodinma, has said that  his stolen mandate has been recovered following Supreme Court judgement  that annulled the election of Emeka Ihedioha. Uzodinma, who spoke through his spokesperson, Declan Emelumba,
shortly after the apex court declared him the duly elected governor of
the state said that the court had demonstrated bravery. The governor-elect accused the Peoples Democratic Party of not having good plans for the state. He said, “The Supreme Court has declared Sen. Hope Uzodinma as the
duly elected governor of Imo State. The beautiful thing is that our
stolen mandate has been recovered. “The governor will arrive in Imo State on Wednesday and he will
address the people of the state. He has better plans for the people of
the state. He is experienced and the state is in for good things.”
