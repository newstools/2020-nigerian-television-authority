President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated his party, All  Progressives Congress (APC) for the Supreme Court judgement that upheld  the elections of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, Kano State and Governor  Simon Lalong, Plateau State on Monday. The President felicitates
with APC National Executive Council, National Working Committee and all
members for the loyalty and consistency that translated into many victories, particularly the politically strategic states, Kano and Plateau, after tough legal challenges. The President said, “I am glad this tortuous journey has ended in
favour of the party and our governors. APC won the states and has proved
it in court. It would have been a major blow if strategically important
states like Kano and Plateau are lost.’’ While congratulating
all the APC governors that the Supreme Court affirmed their elections,
President Buhari urged electorates and politicians to strengthen the
country’s judicial processes by always seeking redress in court. “It has now become standard procedure for the opposition to challenge
any poll or judgement that does not return its candidates. “Election is good when they win. The opposite is the case if someone
else emerges. But that is not the way it works. Democracy is not only
about who wins or who loses, but also about the process. In disparaging
every unfavourable result or judgement, they disparage the entire
system.” Garba Shehu Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
