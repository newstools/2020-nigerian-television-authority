By Lucy Ogalue Mr Fidet Okhiria, Managing Director of the Nigeria Railway Corporation
(NRC), has assured Nigerians of the corporation’s commitment to the
safety of passengers and train along the Abuja-Kaduna Train Service
(AKTS). Okhiria told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja that  NRC’s priority was to ensure safe transportation of all passengers to  their destinations. He denied claims by some national dailies that a train conveying
passengers to Abuja from Kaduna was attacked by suspected gunmen. “This news is not correct. What happened according to the police
escorts on the train is that a stone was thrown at the train by some
boys, which affected only the window glass of coach SP4. “Nigerians should not panic as the news of the suspected attack is
false and NRC is doing everything possible to ensure safety of
passengers,” Okhiria said. NAN reports that some national dailies had reported that armed men
suspected to be kidnappers on Thursday morning attacked an Abuja-bound
train with guns and other weapons. The report alleged that the train, which left the Rigasa train  station in Kaduna, at around 10 a.m. was attacked a few kilometres to  Katari, about 70 kilometres to Abuja.
