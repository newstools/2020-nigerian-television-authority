The
terrorist killing of Lawan Andimi, chairman of the Christian
Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Michika, Adamawa State is cruel, inhuman
and deliberately provocative. My deepest condolences to his family, the
Christian community across Nigeria, and the Government and people of
Adamawa. I am greatly saddened by the fact that the terrorists
went on to kill him even while giving signals of a willingness to set
him free by releasing him to third parties. This barbarism is
condemnable. We will ensure that these terrorists pay a heavy price for
their evil actions. This incident has further strengthened our
resolve as a Government, and the resolve of our gallant Armed Forces, to
comprehensively defeat all terrorist groups sowing death, violence and
destruction in our country and across West Africa. Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa. Iam a graduate of Mass Communication with special interest on social media and Online Editor and a Reporter.
