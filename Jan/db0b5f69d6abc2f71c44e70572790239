The Supreme Court, on Monday, affirmed the election of Aminu Tambuwal
of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as the duly elected governor of
Sokoto State in the March 2019 governorship election. The apex court dismissed an appeal of the candidate of the All
Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Ahmed Sokoto, filed to
challenge Tambuwalâ€™s re-election. A seven-man panel of justices of the court headed by Chief Justice of
Nigeria, CJN, Justice Tanko Muhammad, held that the appellant failed to
adduce any credible evidence to prove his petition against the outcome
of the governorship election. Justice Musa Abba-Ajji who delivered the lead judgement, noted that
whereas the appellant produced 12 witnesses before the tribunal, 11 of
them made their statements in Hausa language while the English version
was tendered in evidence. It held that the appellant failed to tender the original version of
the statements he tendered in evidence and also failed to produce the
translator to confirm the authenticity or otherwise of the 11
statements. Besides, the apex court held that the appellant was unable to prove  that the election was invalid by virtue of non compliance with the  Electoral Act. NAN
