British Airways has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland
China after Britain warned against all but essential travel to the
country due to the coronavirus outbreak. BA.com, the airline’s website, shows no direct flights to China are available in January and February. “We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of
our customers and crew is always our priority,” BA said in an emailed
statement on Wednesday. “Customers due to travel to or from China in the
coming days can find more information on BA.com.” Britain on Tuesday advised against “all but essential” travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak.
